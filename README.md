# DEVELOPING-CUSTOM-CNN-MODEL-FOR-BINARY-CLASSIFICATION-CAT-AND-DOG-
This is a CNN model to classify images whether it is cat or dog. While the output is the accuracy, the main objective of this project is not to get a high accuracy but rather to learn how to use convolution neural network (CNN) for classification using tensorflow.
