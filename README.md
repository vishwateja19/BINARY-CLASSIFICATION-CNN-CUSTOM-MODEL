## DEVELOPING  CUSTOM CNN MODEL FOR BINARY CLASSIFICATION (CAT AND DOG):


This is a  CNN model to classify images whether it is cat or dog. While the output is the accuracy, the main objective of this project is not to get a high accuracy but rather to learn how to use convolution neural network (CNN) for classification using tensorflow.

## DESCRIPTION

In this model development cat and dog dataset is used, through  convolutional neural network(CNN)
we predicted either image is cat or dog.

Since we use tensorflow framework so brief introduction about tensorflow.

TENSORFLOW:

TensorFlow is an open-source software library for deep learning and machine learning developed by Google Brain Team. It is used for a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and computer vision. It is also used to create and train neural networks, which are the backbone of deep learning.


As we collect cat and dog dataset for model development ,using Tensorflow module 'ImageDataGenerator' we rescale image size to train the model. After that we built an architecture using tensorflow includes Kernel layers,maxpooling layers of CNN and followed by hidden layers of ANN.

 The accuracy i got for this model is 0.813% with the epoch size of 20.
